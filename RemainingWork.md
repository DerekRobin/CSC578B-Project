## Interim Report
- Look into how replication papers should be written
- Remove projects with zero duration
- Add new field into data (suggestion is commit frequency, so we need to count number of commits per project in time frame)
    - Run KM and Cox with new field
- Bayesian Analysis Study:
    - Perhaps use exponential or gamma distribution as per [statistical rethinking suggested by Neil](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.library.uvic.ca/library/view/statistical-rethinking-2nd/9780429639142/xhtml/18_Chapter10.xhtml) (search for "survival")
- Think of ideas for future work that we can suggest
- Look into how the software heritage graph is updated (so we can speak about this in our "limitations of the data" section)
