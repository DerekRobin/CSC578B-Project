## Video Presentation
Approx. 5 min video describing your project (motivation, methods, what you learned, what's next).
Some examples are at https://www.youtube.com/c/ICSEconf/videos - look at the 8 min ones. 

The [Old] rubric is:

5 marks: creativity and visual appeal (talking over a slide deck is not very exciting; interpretive dance presentation fun)
10 marks: captures idea of study: motivation, methods, findings described clearly and obviously. 
5 marks: short discussion of implications for practice: what you learned, what's next

The new rubric is:
### Results and approach (5 pts)
Presentation concisely summarizes the approach and key results:

- We should all understand our results better (especially the bayesian results)

### Creativity (5 pts)
Presentation is interesting and engaging:

- This will be a joined effort I imagine. Right now the plan is to make it a PSA style presentation, but maybe we should run this by Neil.
### Discusses implication (5 pts):
Presentation clearly explains implications, including ethical, of the results on practice and research:

- The pre-req for this is to better understand our results and previous work so we can better understand the implications on practice and research.
- One implication is that this research may affect how developers choose which projects they work on. Perhaps there are more ethical projects that do not have a large number of developers or major releases, etc. The hope is that this study would not deter developers from helping good causes simply based on how well the project is already doing. Maybe that developer can make the difference between the survival of that project and its death.
### Explains context (5 pts):
Presentation captures the context and problem/research question of the study, including previous work:

- Apparently Neil intended to mark our project a lot more heavily on the related works than he had indicated (as seen in the feedback for our interim report). I believe we should do a deep dive to find any other research we can and connect it to our project. This will be a big part of the final report too.
