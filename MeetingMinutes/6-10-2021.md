## Meeting 2 - October 6, 2021

Answers to emails:
- Response to first email:
    - "I think the usual mechanic is a strict replication and then some added tweaks. In psych studies the replication is actually quite challenging as you have to re-run experiments. In our project you are just re-running tools, which modulo some randomness should get similar results. You can poke at the assumptions made, and try to find possible flaws to improve on; you can rerun with a different sample as well - do the results still hold up? Like why did they pick that subset?"
- Presentation is 10% (look at grades section on brightspaces)
- Project is due Oct. 15 @6pm
- Project is 10 pages including everything (title, references, etc.), and he says less is fine if we think we've got the deliverables down.
- For resources he referred us to the link he posted in the discussions, amazon has student credit (as Derek pointed out), and we could also check with our supervisors for other possibilities.

Tentative deadlines:
 - Manish thinks we can use AWS lambda service for computing (he will try to have it set up by next meeting (Oct. 12))
 - Try to have experimenting done by end of October or early November

 Tentative Titles:
 - Two differing approaches to survival analysis of open source python projects
